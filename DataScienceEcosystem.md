Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystems are summarized.

# Objectives: 
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running Python code, visualization, and analysis.
- RStudio: IDE for R, used for statistical computing and data visualization.
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
- NumPy: Library for numerical computing and handling arrays.

Some of the popular languages that Data Science use are:
1. Python
2. R
3. SQL
4. Julia
5. Java
6. Scala

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
1. Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
2. TensorFlow (for deep learning)
3. PyTorch (for deep learning)


```python
import pandas as pd  # Importing the pandas library

# Creating a DataFrame to represent the table
data = {
    "Data Science Tools": ["Jupyter Notebook", "RStudio", "VS Code"]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)  # Creating a DataFrame from the data dictionary
print(df)  # Printing the DataFrame to display the table
```

Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.


```python
# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers.
(3*4)+5
```
